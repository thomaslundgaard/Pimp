PyMpdJuke is a MPD frontend, intended to be used as a jukebox at parties. The
interface is made for use with touchscreens without a connected keyboard.

************************************
 INSTALLING
************************************
To run/install it, you need:
	* python
	* pyqt
	* python-mpd (http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd)
Oviously you also need a mpd server to connect to, but it can be running on
another computer and then be controlled remotely by pympdjuke over the network.
You can enter your MPD-server settings in the settings dialog in pympdjuke.

To run the app, directly from the source folder:
	make run

To install to /usr:
	make install

To install into another dir:
	make DESTDIR=/usr/local install

To make a deb package to /usr on debian systems:
	sudo dpkg-buildpackage -tc


************************************
 UBUNTU USERS
************************************
On ubuntu/debian based systems, you first need to install the following
packages (use synaptic or your favorite package manager):
	python-qt4 python-mpd pyqt4-dev-tools
Then you install PyMpdJuke by running the following two commands, from the folder
containing this README:
	make
	sudo make install
Then you should install and setup mpd. To get sound output working, follow the guide at:
	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1298789
Now you're good to go, start PyMpdJuke like any other application from the menu
- or be clever and use gnome-do :).

 THANKS
************************************
We would like to thank the guy(s?) behind flickcharm-python, which is used to
make the UI more touchcreen friendly.

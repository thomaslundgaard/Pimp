PyMpdJuke is a MPD frontend, intended to be used as a jukebox at parties. The
interface is made for use with touchscreens without a connected keyboard.

******************
INSTALLING
******************
To run/install it, you need:
	* python
	* pyqt
	* python-mpd (http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd)
Oviously you also need a mpd server to connect to, but it can be running on
another computer and then be controlled remotely by pympdjuke over the network.
You can enter your MPD-server settings in the settings dialog in pympdjuke.

To run the app, directly from the source folder:
	make run

To install to /usr:
	make install

To install into another dir:
	make DESTDIR=/usr/local install

******************
We would like to thank the guy(s?) behind flickcharm-python, which is used to
make the UI more touchcreen friendly.

Peace out and happy party'ing!

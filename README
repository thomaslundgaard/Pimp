PyMpdJuke is a MPD frontend, intended to be used as a jukebox at parties. The
interface is made for use with touchscreens without a connected keyboard.

Please report bugs on our github page:
http://github.com/thomaslundgaard/PyMpdJuke/issues
If you have any feature requests or other ideas, do feel free to post it on the
github issues page.

 TIPS & TRICKS
************************************
 * The default password is "" (empty).
 * If you want more control over your mpd-server, you can leave a
   conventional mpd-client like mpc, qmpdclient or sonata running in the
   background.
 * To use the volume control, you need to set the mixer_control value in
   mpd.conf. Use amixer to find the value to set it to, I had to set it to
   "Master"
 * It is possible to make mpd cross-fade between songs, all you need to do, is
   to enable it from another mpd-client like mpc, qmpdclient or sonata.
 * If you forgot your password or one of your fellow admins changed it, it can be
   found in the configuration file ~/.config/pympdjuke/PyMpdJuke.conf (it will
   created the first time you change some settings)
 * If you want to change the look (fonts, colors) or sizes of buttons, etc, have
   a look at the QStyleSheet in /usr/share/pympdjuke/resources/stylesheet.qss.
   It's syntax is based on CSS, but adapted to the world of applications, see
   the Qt documentation: http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/stylesheet.html
   If you create a good-looking stylesheet, do share it with the world on out
   github page.

 INSTALLING
************************************
To run/install it, you need:
	* python
	* pyqt
	* python-mpd (http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd)
Oviously you also need a mpd server to connect to, but it can be running on
another computer and then be controlled remotely by pympdjuke over the network.
You can enter your MPD-server settings in the settings dialog in pympdjuke.

To run the app, directly from the source folder:
	make run

To install to /usr:
	make
	sudo make install

To install into another dir:
	make
	sudo make DESTDIR=/usr/local install

************************************
 UBUNTU USERS
************************************
On ubuntu/debian based systems, you first need to install the following
packages (use synaptic or your favorite package manager):
	python-qt4 python-mpd pyqt4-dev-tools
Then you install PyMpdJuke by running the following two commands, from the folder
containing this README:
	make
	sudo make install
Then you should install and setup mpd. To get sound output working, follow the guide at:
	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1298789
Now you're good to go, start PyMpdJuke like any other application from the menu
- or be clever and use gnome-do :).

We would like to thank the guy(s?) behind flickcharm-python, which is used to
make the UI more touchcreen friendly.

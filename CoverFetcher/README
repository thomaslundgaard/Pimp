Description:
Fetches album art from Discogs.com and Last.fm.

The built in Amarok Cover Manager only allows fetching from amazon.com, which may be fine if your music collection largely consists of popular music. But if large parts of your music collection are vinyl rips or releases on underground labels, searching discogs.com will yield much better results.
This script allows fetching album cover art for the currently playing track from discogs.com by clicking onto any track in the playlist and selecting:
"Fetch Covers" -> "For Currently Playing Track"
Already existing local album art (image files from the currently playing track's folder) as well as relevant album art from Last.fm and Discogs.com can then be browsed / saved / deleted.

Hint:
If the window is not opening in the foreground but started minimized with the taskbar item flashing, the KDE focus stealing prevention level doesn't allow focussing our window. This can be fixed by setting this:
System Settings > Window Behaviour > Advanced > Focus Stealing Prevention Level: None

Prerequisites:
- Qt4
- PyQt4 (Python bindings for QT)

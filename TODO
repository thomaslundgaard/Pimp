- allow browsing for songs
- make ui react better when connection to mpd cannot be established (it must be
  posible to change connection settings)
- fix bug: unable to add songs with utf-8 characters in filename to playlist
- (future) interchange flickcharm with QAbstractKineticScroller when Qt becomes real cross-platform again (damn you Nokia)

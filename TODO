- allow browsing for songs
- improve startup db update -- also exception handling
- make ui react better when connection to mpd cannot be established (it must be
  posible to change connection settings)
- make ui react better to long connection times in server.status() (long timeout
  times causes ui hangs)
- try using mpc to set single and consume
- fix bug: unable to add songs with utf-8 characters in filename to playlist
- (future) interchange flickcharm with QAbstractKineticScroller when Qt becomes real cross-platform again (damn you Nokia)
- (optional) automatically download covers and show on main widget
